This directory contains the config files and deployment scripts for the official
chat.imzqqq distribution of Chat Web.

You probably do not want to build with this config unless you're building the
official chat.imzqqq distribution, but these files may be useful if you want to
inspect the configuration used there.

Chat Desktop uses a separate config (see
../../element-desktop/element.io).

Deployment scripts (such as app/deploy.py) are meant to be run on the web server
hosting the Chat installation.
