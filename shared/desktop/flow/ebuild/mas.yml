# The bundleVersion and bundleShortVersion keys in this config correspond to builds in the
# Mac App Store. If you are attempting to upload a new build of the same app version to the
# Mac App Store, change the bundle version. The bundle short version should be the same as
# the app version seen in config.json and package.json.
#
# If you are submitting a new app version entirely, make sure the bundle version and short
# version match accordingly, except in cases where the app version is the same version as an
# older Mac App Store build.
