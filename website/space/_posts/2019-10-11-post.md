I'm so excited to finally release Flow 1.0, the next generation of Flow! This version has been in development for six months and I'm finally glad that we're going to get this in everyone's hands after months of development and testing.

For those interested in release notes, here's the scoop:

- Complete and responsive redesign using the Material design language that extends to desktops
- New settings to change the color scheme, default visibility, and more
- Support using multiple accounts within Flow
- Ability to manage blocked servers easily
- Support for searching accounts, hashtags, and related posts
- Viewing and managing follow requests and recommended follows
- Brand-new composer with better attachments and poll support
- Complete customization with a config file for administrators
- Better notification support with ability to dismiss individual notifications and seeing a badge count (macOS/Linux only)
- A brand-new menubar for desktop apps with keyboard shortcuts

I'd personally like to thank these amazing people:

- My fellow co-developers, Nomad1556 and bio-ico, for helping develop Flow 1.0 to the amazing client it is today.
- All of the amazing people that participated in the beta testing for Flow 1.0. It wouldn't be the client it is today without you!
- All of our supporters on Patreon for helping make Flow possible.
- The amazing developers behind Megalodon (h3poteto), Mastodon (Eugen Rochko), and Material-UI libraries for prodiving the tools necessary to making Flow a reality.
- And, finally, you, fellow Flow user, for supporting us by using Flow.

I can't wait to see what the future brings, and I, on the behalf of the team, hope you enjoy Flow 1.0.0
