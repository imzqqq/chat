Please read the following [link](https://wasabi-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000451052-Can-I-use-Wasabi-to-host-my-videos-) before using.

- "However, we do not recommend the playback of video directly from object storage (Wasabi or AWS S3) as the costs may be higher than expected and the delivery quality will be sub-optimal (as compared to solutions that pair object storage with a CDN and/or encoding/decoding functions)." -Wasabi

Most people would end up paying $5.99/mo with [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/content-delivery/), and there's no additional costs for the amount of people or amount of times people access your video. So if you have a ton of viewers, this is probably a good option.

### Create a user and access key.

1. [Create a new user on Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/wp-content/themes/wasabi/docs/Getting_Started/index.html#t=topics%2FCreating_a_User.htm) for yourself.
1. [Create a new Access Key](https://wasabi.com/wp-content/themes/wasabi/docs/Getting_Started/index.html#t=topics%2FAssigning_an_Access_Key.htm) in the Users Panel.

1. Go to the "Storage" section of the Live Admin and input the required storage details.

Depending on the region where your bucket lives look up the service URL [from this page](https://wasabi-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-regions-).

### Making files public

Wasabi makes it easy to make a bucket public. [Full documentation is here](https://wasabi.com/wp-content/themes/wasabi/docs/Getting_Started/index.html#t=topics%2FMaking_Folders_and_or_Files_Public.htm), but simply select the folder and choose "_Make Public_".

### Expiration of old files on Wasabi

In order to have Wasabi clean up your old files for you, you will need to enable "Compliance Mode" and "Delete After Retention".

2. Open the "COMPLIANCE" section by clicking the named tab
3. Toggle "Compliance Mode" on
4. Toggle "Delete After Retention" on
