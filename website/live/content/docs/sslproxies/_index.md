While not required, most people will want to support SSL on a public Live server. If you already have a [reverse proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/) that is used for SSL you can easily add Live to that. If you've never installed a proxy service before then you can quickly set one up.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="People often overlook the need to proxy their websockets, so if you're having issues with chat make sure you configured your proxy to pass those through." >}}

## Why you want to support SSL

1. If you want to embed your Live video or chat into a page that is using SSL your Live server will also need to be secured.
1. Browsers will label your site as ["Not Secure"](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208672) without using SSL.
1. It looks more professional and your site will come off more trustworthy.
1. Securing web traffic on the public internet is the right thing to do.

## When you might not need it

1. If you're just testing and experimenting with Live.
1. You're running the service internally and you don't have any plans for a public audience.

## Popular options
