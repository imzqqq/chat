title: Live Demo Servers
---

We provide two public Live servers for you to see how it works. One for streaming *to* and one for just watching.

### Stream your content to [broadcast.live.dingshunyu.top](http://broadcast.live.dingshunyu.top)

You can point **your own software and content** at [broadcast.live.dingshunyu.top](http://broadcast.live.dingshunyu.top) to test live streaming with Live. [Go there](http://broadcast.live.dingshunyu.top) and find the current key in the description and chat messages.

Read more about how to configure your software by reading the [broadcasting software documentation](/docs/broadcasting/).

Some limitations and restrictions:

* You can only stream for a few minutes. Long enough to test out the service and verify your software.
* You can't connect if somebody else is already streaming.
* The streaming key will change over time and you'll see it show up as a chat message.

### Watch a test live stream at [watch.live.dingshunyu.top](http://watch.live.dingshunyu.top)

If you just want to see what it's like to watch a currently active Live live stream you can visit [watch.live.dingshunyu.top](http://watch.live.dingshunyu.top) and check it out.
