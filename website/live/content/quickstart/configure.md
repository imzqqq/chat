While Live will work for you out of the box, there are things most people will want to customize after getting it up and running.

Configuration is done through the Live administration page located on your server under `/admin`. The login username is `admin` and the password is your stream key, the default being `abc123`.

Some common items many people would want to update after installing Live are:

* Your site name, logo, description and external links that are displayed on the [web site](/docs/website).
* The **stream key** to gain access to broadcasting to your stream and your admin.
* Enable your stream to show up in the [Live Directory](/docs/directory).
