This repo contains (almost) transparent matrix gateway.
Following features are implemented:

* Sending and receiving emails, both plaintext and HTML.  
   Bridge will dynamically create rooms and invite matrix users/mail puppets when new message appears, see 'Usage' section.
* Turning matrix room into *something like* mailing list.
* Sending and receiving attachments (looks ugly, see end of file).
