## Dept of Servers 🏢

### matrix-oauth

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) reported:

> For those who want to integrate Chat into their application with OAuth, there's now [matrix-oauth](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-oauth) ( [#oauth:t2bot.io](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/#oauth:t2bot.io) ). Ideally useful for "Login with Chat" buttons, this is a relatively easy OAuth 2.0 provider to set up in front of your homeserver. In future it'll support more granular scopes to avoid having to give a real access token to the third party application.
>
> A demo of matrix-oauth in action is available at <https://demo.oauth.t2host.io/>

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Amazon Alexa skill

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) offered:

> Yelling at your Amazon Alexa to send a message to your Chat contacts is now possible with [matrix-alexa-skill](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-alexa-skill) ( [#alexa:t2bot.io](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/#alexa:t2bot.io) ). A hosted version using matrix-oauth is coming soon, assuming I can get the privacy policy and such over to Amazon to review in a timely manner, though you're more than able to self-host in a matter of minutes. Check out the README for more info - some experience with setting up complicated things is required.
