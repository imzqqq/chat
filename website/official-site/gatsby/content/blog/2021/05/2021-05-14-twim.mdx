## Dept of Spec 📜

[Matthew](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reported:

> Some combination of me, Kegan, Bruno and neilalexander have been working on v3 of the CS /sync API. (Today's /sync API in matrix is v2; v1 was the old /events API).  We're not yet at the point of publishing a draft or MSC, but it's coming soon. It's really exciting work which flips Chat around so that sync scales independently of the number of rooms you're in - and it's at last possible to write rich clients which only ever sync the bare minimum data needed to work: i.e. lazy loading eeeeeeeeverything.  Watch this space :)

[anoa](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) told us:

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Chat is the specification - and this is modified by Chat Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.
>
>
> #### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3192: Batch state endpoint](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3192)
> * [MSC3189: Per-room/per-space profile data](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3189)
>
> * [MS3184: Challenges Messages](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3184)
>
> **MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3122: Deprecate starting verifications without requesting first](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3122)
>
> #### Merged Spec PRs
>
> Here are all the actual MSC-related changes made to the raw Chat spec this week!
>
> * [Clarify that implementations can use stable prefixes once an MSC proposal has merged](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179)
>
> #### Spec Updates
>
> There's been activity from the Spec Core Team on a number of different MSCs, such as [MSC3189](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3189) (per-room/space profile data). Additionally a [spec PR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3168) for Chat URI schemes has been getting feedback and is moving forward at a quick pace! There was also some feedback from the team on [MSC2448](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448) (blurhashes) which I'll get around to answering shortly 🙂.
>
> Otherwise I think this week was a bit implementation-heavy for the team (the Spec Core Team is a task in addition to our full-time jobs). Hopefully next week will grant us more of a breather.

[callahad](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@callahad:matrix.org) announced:

> Hello TWiMmers! The bulk of our update is in Chat Live today, so go check out the video above ☝️ to hear about how we're reducing the amount of memory it takes to join large rooms, and why joins take so much memory in the first place.
>
> Otherwise, we're mainly getting ready for the public debut of Spaces as a beta feature, but more on that next week... 😉
>
> Oh, and before we go: please make sure your Chat is up to date! We [released 1.33.2](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/11/synapse-1-33-2-released) on Tuesday, which contains a low severity security fix.



## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Kubernetes

[Ananace](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) offered:

> Another installation of the regularly scheduled Kubernetes [Helm Chart](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) updates (and another bump of the deprecated [Chat image](https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse)). Now up to Chat 1.33.2 and Element Web 1.7.27.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉



### matrix-puppeteer-line

[Fair](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@fair:miscworks.net) told us:

> [matrix-puppeteer-line](https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line): A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.
> 
> This week was spent on stability improvements & bug fixes.
> 
> _Calling for testers!_
> The bridge is at a point where it's mostly usable, but it still has quite a few blindspots. If anyone is willing to try it out & report issues, it would be a great help!
> 
> Discussion: [Chat-LINE Puppeteer bridge](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/#matrix-puppeteer-line:miscworks.net)
> Issue page: https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/issues
>
>  Shout-outs to [@lecris:lecris.me](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@lecris:lecris.me) for being an early tester & having given a lot of useful feedback 🙂

### Gitter

[Eric Eastwood](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org) reported:

### matrix-appservice-irc 0.26.0

[Half-Shot](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) reported:

> Goooooooood afternoon folks and happy Friday! This week we're announcing the [0.26.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.26.0) release of the matrix-appservice-irc bridge which contains precious goodies:
>
> * You can now **disable** the kick behaviour of the bridge on Chat users if you are running a personal bridge, so losing your IRC connection no longer results in a kick.
>
> * You can now remove bridges from rooms by using the admin room, so no need to use the provisioing API or modify the DB.
> * We've added a new feature to allow you to specify bridge options on a per room basis using room state. At the moment you can modify the limits of the automatic pastebin system but more features like reply formats are to come!
>
> As always please come tell us about it in [#irc:matrix.org](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/#irc:matrix.org) and make sure to check out the [new docs](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc) if you get a bit stuck.

## Final Thoughts 💭

From *Dept of Humour in [#twim:matrix.org] 😅*:

* [R1 Airport](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@airportline:matrix.org): Maybe I want to see if I can build some type of bridge between Chat and CUPS.
* [hifi](https://to.chat.dingshunyu.top/#/@hifi:vi.fi):  the sad part is that would probably be more reliable than just printing directly
