We've just released <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.2.0.html">r0.2.0 of the Client-Server API specification</a>. This release bundles up a number of clarifications and incremental improvements, as well as removing some outdated text relating to the pre-r0 event syncing APIs.

We've also taken the opportunity to make the license on the specifications <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/intro.html#license">explicit</a> (we're using the Apache license), and have finally settled a long-running argument on <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/intro.html#user-identifiers">what a user ID should look like</a>.

As ever, the evolution of the spec has been helped tremendously by contributions and bug reports from the members of community - thanks to all those who have helped it on its way!
