# Authenticating

To authenticate with services, you must first have a DM room with the bridge set up. In this guide,
we are going to assume the bot is called `@hookshot:example.com` but this will vary for your setup. For all
the instructions below, commands should only be executed in the DM room.

## GitHub

You can authenticate via OAuth or a Personal Access Token (PAT) when using GitHub. Authentication is required
when trying to bridge GitHub resources into rooms.

<section class="notice">
Please note that you will need a Personal Access Token in order to bridge your personal GitHub notifications.
This is a limitation of GitHub's API.
</section>


To authenticate with a personal access token:
1. Open [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (Github > Settings > Developer Settings / Personal access tokens)
1. Click **Generate new token**
1. Give it a good name, and a sensible expiration date. For scopes you will need:
    - Repo (to access repo information)
      - public_repo
      - repo:status
    - Workflow (if you want to be able to launch workflows / GitHub actions from Matrix)
    - Notifications (if you want to bridge in your notifications to Matrix)
    - User
      - read:user
    - write:discussion (for GitHub discussion support)
      - read:discussion

1. Send the generated token to the bridge by saying `github setpersonaltoken %your-token%`. You can redact
  the message afterwards if you like.
1. The bridge will have connected you. You can check the status at any time by saying `github hastoken`

## GitLab

You can authenticate with GitLab by supplying a Personal Access Token. OAuth-style authentication isn't supported
yet.

- You will need to have configured a GitLab instance in your config.yml for the instance you want to log in to.
- Open https://%instance%/-/profile/personal_access_tokens (GitLab > User Settings > Access Tokens), where instance is your GitLab instance address.
  - For the public GitLab server, this would be "gitlab.com"
- Give it a good name, and a sensible expiration date. For scopes you will need to tick `api`.
- Send the generated token to the bridge by saying `gitlab personaltoken %instance% %your-token%`. You can redact
  the message afterwards if you like.
- The bridge will have connected you. You can check the status at any time by saying `gitlab hastoken %instance% `


## JIRA

You can log in to JIRA via OAuth. This means you will need to have configured OAuth support in your `config.yml`, and
have the endpoints required accessible from the internet. Authentication is required when trying to bridge JIRA resources into rooms.

- Say `jira login` to get the URL to authenticate via.
- Click the URL sent by the bot.
- Follow the steps, ensuring you authenticate with the right user.
- If all goes well, you will now be connected. You can check the status and authorisatied instances by saying `jira whoami`
