# metatext-apns

This is a simple service to relay [WebPush](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030) notifications to Apple's push notification service. It was designed for [Metatext](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext), an iOS Mastodon client, but could theoretically be used for other purposes.

## Setup

### Environment

`metatext-apns` uses a [token-based connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns). You will need to set the following environment variables based on a key generated in the Apple developer portal:

* `APNS_KEY_ID`
* `APNS_AUTH_KEY`

You will also need to set these:

* `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
* `TOPIC`

Finally, you will need to specify the size of the connection pool:

* `CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE`

### Client

The service sets `{ "loc-key" : "apns-default-message" }` for the `alert` key of the `aps` payload dictionary. If decrypting the notification on the client fails, the value for `"apns-default-message"` in your `Localizable.strings` file is what will be displayed.

## Usage

Register your push subscription to call the endpoint `/push/:device_token/:id` (adding `?sandbox=true` for debug builds) on the domain you are hosting the service, where `device_token` is the device token received in `application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data)` in the client as a Base16 string and `id` is an identifier for which account on the client the notification belongs to. The service will deliver notifications with the `mutable-content` key set to `1` so a notification service extension can decrypt them. The notifications will have these keys in their custom payload:

* `i`: The `id` path component of the subscription URL
* `m`: The encrypted message as a URL-safe Base64 string
* `s`: The salt as a URL-safe Base64 string
* `k`: The server's public key as a URL-safe Base64 string

See Metatext's [notification service extension](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext/blob/main/Notification%20Service%20Extension/NotificationService.swift) and [push notification parsing service](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext/blob/main/ServiceLayer/Sources/ServiceLayer/Services/PushNotificationParsingService.swift) for an example of how to decrypt the notifications in a notification service extension.

## Deployment

`metatext-apns` is a [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) application, and can be deployed like any other [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack)-based application. It is set up to be run using the [Puma](https://puma.io) web server.
