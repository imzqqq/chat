# mautrix-imessage
Welcome to the mautrix-imessage docs!

mautrix-imessage is a Matrix-iMessage puppeting bridge. The bridge has three
different ways to connect to iMessage:

* Normal Mac. Built into mautrix-imessage. Uses AppleScript to send, reads the
  iMessage SQLite database to receive, and uses Contacts.framework for contact
  list access.
* Mac with SIP disabled. Uses [Barcelona] to hook into Apple's private iMessage
  frameworks on a Mac. Requires disabling SIP and AMFI to be able to hook into
  private frameworks.
* Jailbroken iOS. Uses [Brooklyn] to hook into Apple's private iMessage
  frameworks on a jailbroken iOS device.
* Additionally, there's [android-sms], an Android app that implements the same
  [IPC protocol] as Brooklyn and Barcelona to bridge SMS from an Android phone.

You can find setup instructions for each of the connectors in the sidebar.
