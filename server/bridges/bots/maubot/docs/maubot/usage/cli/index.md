# maubot cli
Maubot includes the `mbc` (**m**au**b**ot **C**LI) tool for some management
tasks.

When you install maubot, `mbc` will be available inside the virtual environment
automatically. You can install maubot locally without actually running the
server to get the `mbc` command.

To get started with `mbc`, first log into your maubot instance using `mbc login`.
