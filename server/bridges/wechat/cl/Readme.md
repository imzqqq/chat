# Easy `matrix-appservice-wechaty`

This is a simple and fast temporary deployment solution that provides a way to experience the main functions of [matrix-appservice-wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/matrix-appservice-wechat). After some simple steps you can deploy a synapse server and a matrix-appservice-wechaty server. At present, in order to have a better experience, we need a domain name and a computer with a public IP address. Fortunately, we are designing a full-featured deployment plan for unpublic IP and domain names, and it is expected to be released this year(If it's necessary. ^_^).

2. Open any [Matrix client](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#clients),and to login with the homeserver(http://localhost:8080) and the user/password(test/passwd). Another optional web client is [element.wechaty.tk](https://element.wechaty.tk/#/login), which allows us to edit the target matrix homeserver.
