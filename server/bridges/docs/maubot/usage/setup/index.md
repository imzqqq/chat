# Setup
## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or higher with `pip` and `virtualenv`
* (For dev setup) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Production setup
1. Create a directory (`mkdir maubot`) and enter it (`cd maubot`).
   **Do not clone the repository.** If you want to use a specific version from
   git rather than PyPI, use the development setup instructions.
2. Set up a virtual environment.
   1. Create with `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 .` (note the dot at the end)
      * You should not use a subdirectory for the virtualenv in this production
        setup. The pip install step places some required files at the root of
        the environment.
   2. Activate with `source ./bin/activate`
3. Install with `pip install --upgrade maubot`
4. Copy `example-config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and update to your liking.  
   **N.B.** If you created a virtualenv in a different directory than `.`
   (e.g. in `.venv`), you must manually copy `example-config.yaml` from the
   virtualenv directory to the directory you're running maubot in (or provide
   the path to the example config when starting maubot). Maubot will not
   function without access to the example config, as it is used for keeping
   your config file up to date.
5. Create the log directory and all directories used in `plugin_directories`
   (usually `mkdir plugins trash logs`).
6. Start with `python3 -m maubot`.
7. Create the database with `alembic upgrade head`. If you have a custom config
   path, use `alembic -x config=/path/to/config.yaml upgrade head`.
8. The management interface should now be available at
   <http://localhost:29316/chat/maubot> or whatever you configured.

### Upgrading
1. Run the install command again (step #3).
2. Restart maubot.

## Development setup
0. Clone the repository.
1. _Optional, but strongly recommended:_ Set up a virtual environment.
   1. Create with `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 .venv`
   2. Activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `pip install --editable .` (note the dot at the end)
4. Build the frontend:
   1. `cd maubot/management/frontend`
   2. Install dependencies with `yarn`
   4. Build with `yarn build`
5. _Optional:_ Configure [debug file open] so that you can open files in your
   IDE by clicking on stack trace lines in the frontend log viewer.
6. Continue from step 4 of the production setup.

### Upgrading
1. Pull changes from Git.
2. Update dependencies with `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`.
3. Restart maubot.
