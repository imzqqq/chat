# Shortcuts
### Keyboard
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> are interchangeable in most keybindings, but
the other one may not work depending on your terminal emulator.

* Switch rooms: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd>
* Scroll chat (page): <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDown</kbd>
* Jump to room: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>, type part of a room's name,
  then <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate and select room
* Plaintext mode: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>
* Newline: <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>
* Autocompletion: <kbd>Tab</kbd> (emojis, usernames, room aliases and commands)

#### Editing messages
<kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> can be used at the start and end of the input area
to jump to edit the previous or next message respectively.

#### Selecting messages
After using commands that require selecting messages (e.g. `/reply` and
`/redact`), you can move the selection with <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd>
confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### Mouse
* Click to select message (for commands such as `/reply` that act on a message)
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + click on image to open in your default image viewer (`xdg-open`)
* Click on a username to insert a mention of that user into the composer
