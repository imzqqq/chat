# @tube/videojs-contextmenu

A cross-device context menu UI for video.js players. Forked from [videojs-contextmenu-ui](https://github.com/brightcove/videojs-contextmenu-ui) to add support for features needed in PeerTube's development.

Features added:
 * support for content as a function, allowing dynamic menus evaluated on `oncontextmenu` event
