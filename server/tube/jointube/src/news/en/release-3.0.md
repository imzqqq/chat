  We would like to thank every person who has contributed to the fundraising of the v3 for their generosity (especially
  in a difficult time for everyone). Thanks also to the sponsors of this v3, Octopuce, Code Lutin and the Debian
  project. Last but not least, our deepest thanks to every person who, in their own way, worked and contributed to help
  this v3 get complete.
