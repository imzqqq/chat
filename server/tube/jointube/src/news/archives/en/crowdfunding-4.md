Hello everyone!

We are now in mid-October! As promised, we have just released the first stable version of Tube.

It implements all stretch goals we planned in our crowdfunding:

- Localization support (as we write these lines, Tube is already available in 13 different languages!)
- Subtitles support
- Ability to import videos through an URL (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion and many others!)
- Ability to import a video through a torrent file or a magnet URI
- RSS feeds, allowing you to track new videos published in all federated Tube instances, in a specific Tube instance or in a video channel you like. You can also subscribe to comment feeds!
- A more relevant search, with the ability to set advanced filters (duration, category, tags...)
- Subscriptions throughout the federation: you can follow your favorite video channels and see all the videos on a dedicated page
- Redundancy system: a Tube instance can help sharing some videos from another instance

We know that feature descriptions are not very amusing, so we have published a few demonstration videos:

This is the last newsletter regarding the Tube crowdfunding. We would like to thank you one more time, for allowing us to greatly improve Tube, and therefore to promote a more decentralized web. But the journey does not end here: we will continue to work on the software, and there is still a lot to do to fully free up video streaming. But before anything, we'll take a few days off ;)

We remind you that you can ask questions on [the Tube forum](https://framacolibri.org/c/qualite/tube). You can also contact us directly on https://contact.framasoft.org.

Cheers,
Framasoft
