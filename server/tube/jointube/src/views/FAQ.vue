          <div>
            <p v-translate>
              Tube is software that you install on a web server. It allows you to create a video hosting website, so create your
              "homemade YouTube".
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              The difference to YouTube is that it's not intended to create a huge platform centralizing videos from the whole world on a
              single server farm (which is horribly expensive).
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              On the contrary, Tube's concept is to create a network of multiple small interconnected video hosting providers.

              Tube is unique because (as far as we know) it's the only video hosting web application which combines three
              advantages:

              Tube is developed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://framasoft.org">Framasoft</a>, a French non-profit popular educational organization on digital issues.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              It employs a developer, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz">Chocobozzz</a>, who works since 2018 on Tube projects:

            </ul>

            <p v-translate>
              Moreover, Chocobozzz works on internal Framasoft's projects (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://framapad.org">Framapad</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://framatalk.org">Framatalk</a>, etc.).
              In other words, the management of Tube projects is operated by only one employee, who has other responsabilities in addition to his workload.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Other Framasoft's volunteers and salaried members also contribute to the Tube project on various aspects (strategy, communication, development, community animation).
              Nevertheless, Tube is not developed by a startup with a team of 50 people, and a workflow full of hyper-formatted processes.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Framasoft will therefore takes the time to improve the software progressively, at its own pace and with its atypical methods which, so far, have proven to be rather effective.

              No it is not.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Tube is a software created, developed and maintained by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://framasoft.org">Framasoft</a>, a French non-profit popular educational organization on digital issues.
              Framasoft has a French culture, respects French laws and is a political actor (« who participates in the life of the city-state ») of civil society.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Tube is part of several actions assembled by Framasoft in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://contributopia.org">Contributopia roadmap</a>.
              These actions aim to propose alternative digital tools to those coming from surveillance capitalism, so that people who do not recognize themselves in such a system can create spaces of freedom.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Consequently, Tube development and/or management of websites associated with the Tube project (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://joinpeertube.org">joinpeertube.org</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://instances.joinpeertube.org">instances.joinpeertube.org</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://search.joinpeertube.org/">search.joinpeertube.org</a>, etc.) may not please everyone (in particular because of different ideas, ideologies of cultures).
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              We respect that, and remind that all software of the Tube project is free software and can be installed with their own domain name.

            <p v-translate>We can answer with certainty: no!</p>

            <p v-translate>The ambition remains to be <strong>a free and decentralized alternative</strong>: the goal of an alternative is

            <p v-translate>Yes, Framasoft holds the "Tube" trademark in several countries for preventive purposes.</p>

            <p v-translate>
              Framasoft affirms here its intention to not use intellectual property for predatory purposes or to constrain
              legitimate uses of the software.
              However, Framasoft reserves the right to use trademark law, especially in case of damage to the image of the Tube
              project, edited by Framasoft.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              We recommend you to create your own digital identity, without using "Tube" for your project
              (software name, website domain...) to not confuse people about who is behind the website/project.

              Framasoft has no control over who downloads Tube, and who installs or uses it.
              Nor does Microsoft or Adobe have any control over who uses Word or Photoshop and for what purposes.

              Your web browser sends a view to the server after 30 seconds of playback.
              If a video is less than 30 seconds in length, a view is sent after 75% of the video duration.
              After giving a view, that IP address cannot add another view in the next hour.
              Views are buffered, so don't panic if the view counter stays the same after you watched a video.

              Being free doesn't mean being above the law! Each Tube hosting provider can decide on its own general conditions of use,
              abiding by their local laws.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              For example, in France, discriminatory content
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_contre_le_racisme_et_les_discours_de_haine">is prohibited</a>
              and may be reported to authorities. Tube allows users to report problematic videos, and administrator must then
              apply its moderation in accordance with its terms and conditions and the law.

            <p v-translate>There are none at the moment: Tube is a tool that we wanted neutral in terms of monetization.</p>

            <p v-translate>
              For now, the solution proposed the <strong>support</strong> button under the video. This button
              displays a frame in which people who upload videos can display text, images, and links freely
              (link to Patreon, Tipeee, Paypal, Liberapay...).
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              We did not go any further, as we refuse to tie our code to a particular content funding method,
              that might not fit all communities and deter others.
              It's the reason why we encourage developers to use the

          <div>
            <p v-translate>
              Tube should run happily on a virtual machine with 2 threads/vCPUs, at least 1 Gb of RAM and enough storage for videos.
              In terms of bandwidth, a lot will depend on which Tube instances you federate with and what your relation with
              them is (more about that below).
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              As a real life example, the Tube demonstration server https://tube.cpy.re runs on 2 vCores and 2GB of RAM.
              Average consumption is:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li v-translate>CPU: nginx ~ 2%, tube ~ 10%, postgres ~ 1%, redis ~ 1%</li>
              <li v-translate>RAM: nginx ~ 1MB, tube ~ 150MB, postgres ~ 30MB, redis ~ 20MB</li>
              <li v-translate>Network: ~200GB sent per month (https://framatube.org: ~1.5TB sent per month)</li>
            </ul>

            <strong v-translate>CPU</strong>

            <p v-translate>
              Except for video transcoding, a Tube instance is not CPU bound. Neither Nginx, Tube itself, PostgreSQL nor
              Redis require a lot of computing power. If it were only for those, one could easily get by with just one thread/vCPU.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              You will hugely benefit from at least a second thread though, because of transcoding. Transcoding is very cpu intensive.
              It serves two purposes on a Tube instance: it ensures all videos can be played optimally in the web interface, and it
              generates different resolutions for the same video. Tube support for offloading transcoding to other machines is
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/Tube/issues/947">being discussed</a>,
              but not yet implemented.
            </p>

            <strong v-translate>RAM</strong>

            <p v-translate>
              1/2 GB of RAM should be plenty for a basic Tube instance, which usually takes at most 150 MB in RAM.
              The only reason you might want more would be if you colocate your Redis or PostgreSQL services on a non-SSD system.
            </p>

            <strong v-translate>Storage</strong>
            <p v-translate>
              There are two important angles to storage: disk space usage and sustained read speed.
              To make a rough estimate of your disk space usage requirements, you want to know the answer to three questions:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li v-translate>What is the total size of the videos you wish to stream?</li>
              <li v-translate>
                Do you want to enable transcoding? If so, do you want to provide multiple resolutions per video? Try this out with a
                few videos and you will get an idea of how much extra space is required per video and estimate a multiplication factor for
                future space allocation.
              </li>
              <li v-translate>
                Which sharing mechanisms do you want to enable? Just WebTorrent, or also HLS with p2p? If you want both,
                this will double your storage needs.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p v-translate>
              In terms of read speed, you want to make sure that you can saturate your network uplink serving Tube videos.
              This should not be a problem with SSD disks, whereas traditional HDD should be accounted for: typical sustained read rates
              for a well tuned system with a 7200rpm hard disk should hover around 120 MB/s or 960 Mbit/s. The latter should be enough
              for a typical 1 Gbit/s network uplink.
            </p>

            <strong v-translate>Network</strong>
            <p v-translate>
              A rough estimate of a traditional server's video streaming network capacity is usually quite straightforward.
              You simply divide your server's available bandwidth by the average bandwidth per stream, and you have an upper bound.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Take a server for example with a 1 Gbit/s uplink for example pushing out 1080p60 streams at 5 Mbit/s per stream.
              That means the absolute theoretical upper capacity bound is 200 simultaneous viewers if your server's disk i/o can keep up.
              Expect a bit less in practice.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              But what if you need to serve more users? That's where Tube's federation feature shines. If other Tube instances
              following yours, chances are they have decided to mirror part of your instance! The feature is called "server redundancy"
              and caches your most popular videos to help serve additional viewers. While viewers themselves contribute a little additional
              bandwidth while watching the video in their browsers (mostly during surges), mirroring servers have a much greater uplink
              and will help your instance with sustained higher concurrent streaming.

              We <strong>try</strong> to keep compatibility with the latest minor version (2.3.1 with 2.2 for example).
              Unfortunately we don't have enough resources to keep compatibility with other versions.

              "It's outrageous and unconscionable: you're releasing a Tube version that doesn't contain the necessary tools
              to effectively manage videos claimed by rights holders, or to effectively manage the issue of online harassment in comments,
              or to effectively manage monetization through advertising, or to (insert here your request to Tube). It will never work!
              What do you intend to do about it?"
            </blockquote>

            <p v-translate>
              You're right. Tube is not the perfect tool, far from it. And we never promised this software would include all
              the features corresponding to every use cases.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Remember that Tube has only <a href="#who-is-working-on-tube">one full time developer</a> and a small handful
              of very involved volunteers. It is not a product developed by a start-up with a full time team and significant financial
              support.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              So if you feel that Tube does not currently meet your needs, it's simple: don't use it right
              now. We remind you that we don't make money developing Tube, and if we obviously hope for its success,
              Framasoft does not depend on it to continue its activities.

              <a href="#what-are-the-tube-features-for-administrators">Yes it does!</a>
              Since the first stable release of Tube in October 2018, <strong>every release</strong> added or improved moderation
              features:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 1.1</strong> added bulk actions in the admin users table and instance/account muting;</li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 1.2</strong> added the ability to unfederate a video on blacklist; the notification system
                now shows reports, and new users;
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 1.3</strong> added the possibility for admins to automatically quarantine new videos for
                new/untrusted users until a moderator reviews it. The instance's followers management was also reworked: UI is improved,
                follows can be denied;
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 1.4</strong> added a plugin system, and made sure plugins can for instance automatically
                blacklist videos or reject comments based on any rule (similar to Pleroma MRF);
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 2.0</strong> setup now asks the admin to answer questions regarding their moderation policy
                and dedication to it. Make a feature to automatically follow a public index of Tube instances part of core Tube,
                instead of leaving admins to script it themselves. This allows instance administrators to automatically follow instances of
                a "follow list" of their choice; a list which is self-hostable, so that communities can grow at their own pace;
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 2.1</strong> added an <em>internal</em> privacy mode to videos (such videos won't be shared
                outside of the instance), and added quick access to moderation tools below the comments and hooks to create registration
                plugins (geoblocking or captchas for example); some third-party plugins already demonstrate this ability. This release also
                put emphasis on describing moderation features within the interface: warnings for features that might increase moderation
                work like autofollow, and descriptions to the action dropdowns.
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 2.2</strong> greatly improved video abuses management
                (search, abuses display, actions on the video or account etc), added moderation hooks and helpers in the plugins API and
                Framasoft developed an experimental <em>Auto mute</em> plugin based on public lists.
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 2.3</strong> improved the report modal and added predefined reasons selection.
                This version made it possible to delete all the comments of an account and Framasoft developed an experimental
                <em>Auto block videos</em> plugin based on public lists.
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 2.4</strong> added ability to report accounts and comments, a messaging system between the
                local reporter of an abuse and moderators, and an abuse management view for users.
              </li>
              <li v-translate><strong>Tube 3.0</strong> added a dedicated view to manage comments of the instance (list, filter, remove
                in bulk etc).
              </li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>

          <div>
            <p v-translate>
              Tube uses ActivityPub because this federation protocol is recommended by the W3C and is also used by other projects like
              the social network <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              IPFS is a great technology, but it still seems too young for streaming large files.
              The Tube P2P system based on well established protocols like HTTP and WebRTC, and the
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tube.docs.imzqqq.top/admin-following-instances?id=instances-redundancy">redundancy system</a>
              are more easy for us to use and to maintain.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              DTube does not seem open source, because publishing only compiled code hinders freedom of modification.
            </p>

            <p v-translate>
              Tube does not impose any remuneration model. This is the choice we have made, and others (like DTube) have made
              other choices. So it's up to you to see what suits you.
