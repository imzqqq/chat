# ActivityPub

Each Tube instance is able to fetch video from other compatible servers it follows, in a process known as “federation”.
Federation is implemented using the ActivityPub protocol, in order to leverage existing tools and be
compatible with other services such as Mastodon, Pleroma and [many more](https://fediverse.network/).

Federation in Tube is twofold: videos metadata are shared as activities for inter-server communication
in what amounts to sharing parts of one's database, and user interaction via comments which are compatible
with the kind of activity textual platforms like Mastodon use.

### Follow

Follow is an activity standardized in the ActivityPub specification (see [Follow Activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#follow-activity-inbox)).
The Follow activity is used to subscribe to the activities of another actor (a server
subscribing to another server's videos, a user subscribing to another user's videos).

##### Supported on

- Actor (`tube` actor, account actor or channel actor)

### Accept

##### Supported on

- Follow

### Reject

Reject is an activity standardized in the ActivityPub specification (see [Reject Activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#reject-activity-inbox)).

##### Supported on

- Follow

### Undo

Undo is an activity standardized in the ActivityPub specification (see [Undo Activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#undo-activity-inbox)).
The Undo activity is used to undo a previous activity.

##### Supported on

- [Follow](#follow)
- [Like](#like)

### Create

Create is an activity standardized in the ActivityPub specification (see [Create Activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#create-activity-inbox)).

### View

View is an activity standardized in the ActivityStream specification (see [View Activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-view)). A Tube instance sends a `View` activity every time a user viewed a video. If a user is watching a live video, a `View` is sent periodically.

##### Supported on

### Video

!> **Note:** this object extends the ActivityPub specification, and therefore some properties are not part of it.

#### Structure

The model structure definition lies in [shared/models/activitypub/objects/video-torrent-object.ts](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/Tube/blob/develop/shared/models/activitypub/objects/video-torrent-object.ts).

### Playlist

!> **Note:** this object is not standard to the ActivityPub specification.

The model structure definition lies in [shared/models/activitypub/objects/playlist-object.ts](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/Tube/blob/develop/shared/models/activitypub/objects/playlist-object.ts).

[playlist object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocobozzz/Tube/develop/shared/models/activitypub/objects/playlist-object.ts ':include :type=code')


### CacheFile

!> **Note:** this object is not standard to the ActivityPub specification.

The object is used to represent a cached file. It is usually sent by third-party servers to the origin server hosting a video
file (a resolution from a `Video`), to notify it that they have put up a copy of that file. The origin server should
then add the server emitting the `CacheFile` to the list of [WebSeeds](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html) for that file.

#### Structure

The model structure definition lies in [shared/models/activitypub/objects/cache-file-object.ts](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/Tube/blob/develop/shared/models/activitypub/objects/cache-file-object.ts).

[cache file object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocobozzz/Tube/develop/shared/models/activitypub/objects/cache-file-object.ts ':include :type=code')

### Note

A `Note` is usually a comment made to a video. Since most ActivityPub textual platforms use the `Note` object for their
messages, most of them can interact in the same way with Tube videos, making them able to comment Tube videos
directly! A `Note` is emitted along the Video publication object: the former is used to notify textual platforms of
the Fediverse, the latter to notify the Vidiverse.

### Playlist

!> **Note:** this object is not standard to the ActivityPub specification.

The object is used to represent a video playlist. It extends [OrderedCollectionPage](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-orderedcollectionpage) and items are [PlaylistElement](#playlist-element).

!> **Note:** this object is not standard to the ActivityPub specification.

The object is used to represent a video playlist element inside the `Playlist` object.
