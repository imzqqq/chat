# Search

There are multiple ways to make a search on Tube. The administrator can enable or disable each one.


## Instance search

In this mode, the search will only display results known by your instance (so videos and channels of instances followed by your current instance).


## Global search

*Has to be enabled by your admin*

In this mode, your instance will use an external global index to make a search. The results are not scoped to videos and channels
known by your instance. For example, you can search videos of instances that are not followed by your current instance.


## URI/handle search

*Could be disabled by your admin*

You can search a specific remote video that may not be federated with your instance using its URL (for example: https://tube.cpy.re/videos/watch/da2b08d4-a242-4170-b32a-4ec8cbdca701).

You can also search a specific remote channel using its URL or the channel handle (for exampel: https://tube.cpy.re/accounts/chocobozzz or `chocobozzz@tube.cpy.re`).
