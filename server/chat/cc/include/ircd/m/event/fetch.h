/// `m::event` via that upcast. The data backing this `m::event` is a zero-copy
/// reference into the database and its lifetime is governed by the internals
/// of this object.
///
/// This can be constructed from either an event::idx or an `event_id`; the
/// latter will incur an extra m::index() lookup. The constructor will throw
/// for a missing event; the nothrow overloads will set a boolean indicator
/// instead. A default constructor can also be used; after construction the
/// seek() ADL suite can be used to the above effect.
///
/// The data is populated by one of two query types to the database; this is
/// determined automatically by default, but can be configured further with
/// the options structure.

/// selection based on what properties of the `m::event` will be accessed.
///
/// - Row Query: The event is populated by conducting a set of point lookups
/// for the selected keys. The point lookups are parallelized so the latency
/// of a lookup is only limited to the slowest key. The benefit of this type
/// is that very efficient I/O and caching can be conducted, but the cost is
/// that each lookup in the row occupies a hardware I/O lane which is a limited
/// resource shared by the whole system.
///
/// - JSON Query: The event is populated by conducting a single point lookup
/// to a database value containing the full JSON string of the event. This
/// query is made when all keys are selected. The benefit of this query is that
/// it only occupies one hardware I/O lane in contrast with the row query. The
/// cost is that the full event JSON is read from storage (up to 64_KiB) and
/// maintained in cache.
