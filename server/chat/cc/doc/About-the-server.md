* Memory use is about 150 MB for a fresh install, 600 MB after a week (by joining a dozen largest available rooms).

* Database is RocksDB. Fast. Small. Tough to query directly. ;-) But you have both *console* and *!control* room.

* It's written mainly in C++. It's fast.

* Created around 2008 and forked around 2016.
