-- we use bigint elsewhere in the database for appservice txn ids (notably,
-- application_services_state.last_txn), and generally we use bigints everywhere else
-- we have monotonic counters, so let's bring this one in line.

-- assuming there aren't thousands of rows for decommisioned/non-functional ASes, this
-- table should be pretty small, so safe to do a synchronous ALTER TABLE.
