This should be incremented whenever the codebase changes its requirements on the

older versions of Chat server).

See https://chat.docs.dingshunyu.top/development/database_schema.html
for more information on how this works.

Changes in SCHEMA_VERSION = 61:
    - The `user_stats_historical` and `room_stats_historical` tables are not written and
      are not read (previously, they were written but not read).

Changes in SCHEMA_VERSION = 63:
    - The `public_room_list_stream` table is not written nor read to
      (previously, it was written and read to, but not for any significant purpose).
