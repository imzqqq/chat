# MSC 1759 - Rooms V2

This MSC proposes creating a new room version to allow servers and users to opt
in to using the new state resolution algorithm.


## Proposal

The new room version is called "2". The only difference between v2 and v1 is
that v2 rooms use the v2 state resolution algorithm, as defined in MSC 1442 and
MSC 1693.

It is not proposed that servers change the default room version used when
creating new rooms.
