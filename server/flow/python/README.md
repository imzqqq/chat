# Flow

**Still in early development/I do not recommend to run an instance yet.**

<!-- start -->

## Features

- Implements a basic [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) server (with federation)
  - S2S (Server to Server) and C2S (Client to Server) protocols
  - Compatible with [Flow](https://flow.join.dingshunyu.top/) and others ([Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), Misskey, Plume, PixelFed, Hubzilla...)
- Exposes your outbox as a basic microblog
  - Support all content types from the Fediverse (`Note`, `Article`, `Page`, `Video`, `Image`, `Question`...)
  - Markdown support
  - Server-side code syntax highlighting
- Comes with an admin UI with notifications and the stream of people you follow
  - Private "bookmark" support
  - List support
  - Allows you to attach files to your notes
  - Custom emojis support
- Cares about your privacy
  - The image upload endpoint strips EXIF meta data before storing the file
  - Every attachment/media is cached (or proxied) by the server
- No JavaScript, **that's it**. Even the admin UI is pure HTML/CSS
  - (well except for the Emoji picker within the admin, but it's only few line of hand-written JavaScript)
- Easy to customize (the theme is written Sass)
  - mobile-friendly theme
  - with dark and light version
- IndieWeb citizen
  - Microformats aware (exports `h-feed`, `h-entry`, `h-cards`, ...)
    - Export a feed in the HTML that is WebSub compatible
  - Partial [Micropub](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/) support ([implementation report](https://micropub.rocks/implementation-reports/servers/416/s0BDEXZiX805btoa47sz))
  - Implements [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/) endpoints (authorization and token endpoint)
    - You can use your ActivityPub identity to login to other websites/app (with U2F support)
  - Send [Webmentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) to linked website (only for public notes)
  - Exports RSS/Atom/[JSON](https://jsonfeed.org/) feeds
  - You stream/timeline is also available in an (authenticated) JSON feed
- Comes with a tiny HTTP API to help posting new content and and read your inbox/notifications
- Deployable with Docker (Docker compose for everything: dev, test and deployment)
- Focused on testing
  - Tested against the [official ActivityPub test suite](https://test.activitypub.rocks/), see [the results](https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/)
  - [CI runs "federation" tests against two instances](https://d.a4.io/imzqqq/microblog.pub)
  - Project is running 2 up-to-date instances ([here](https://microblog.pub) and [there](https://a4.io))
  - Manually tested against other major platforms

## User Guide

Remember that _microblog.pub_ is still in early development.

The easiest and recommended way to run _microblog.pub_ in production is to use the provided docker-compose config.

First install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
Python is not needed on the host system.

Note that all the generated data (config included) will be stored on the host (i.e. not only in Docker) in `config/` and `data/`.

### Installation

Once the initial configuration is done, you can still tweak the config by editing `config/me.yml` directly.

### Deployment

To spawn the docker-compose project (running this command will also update _microblog.pub_ to latest and restart everything if it's already running):

```shell
make run
```

By default, the server will listen on `localhost:5005` (<http://localhost:5005> should work if you're running locally).

For production, you need to setup a reverse proxy (nginx, caddy) to forward your domain to the local server
(and check [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) for getting a free TLS certificate).

### Backup

The easiest way to backup all of your data is to backup the `microblog.pub/` directory directly (that's what I do and I have been able to restore super easily).
It should be safe to copy the directory while the Docker compose project is running.

## Development

The project requires Python3.7+.

The most convenient way to hack on _microblog.pub_ is to run the Python server on the host directly, and evetything else in Docker.

```shell
# One-time setup (in a new virtual env)
$ python3 -m venv ./.venv
$ source ./.venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
# Start MongoDB and poussetaches
$ make poussetaches
$ env POUSSETACHES_AUTH_KEY="<secret-key>" docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
# Run the server locally
$ FLASK_DEBUG=1 MICROBLOGPUB_DEBUG=1 FLASK_APP=app.py POUSSETACHES_AUTH_KEY="<secret-key>" flask run -p 5005 --with-threads
```
