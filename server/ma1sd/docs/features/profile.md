# Profile
The profile feature does not do anything on its own and acts as a support feature for others, allowing to retrieve
information about a user based on its Matrix ID by querying enabled [Identity stores](../stores/README.md).

Currently supported:
- Display name
- 3PIDs
- Roles/Groups

Experimental sub-features are also available. See [the dedicated document](experimental/profile.md).
